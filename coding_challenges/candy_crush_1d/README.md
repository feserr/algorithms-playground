# Candy crush 1D

Write a function to crush candy in one dimensional board. In candy crushing
games, groups of like items are removed from the board. In this problem, any
sequence of 3 or more like items should be removed and any items adjacent to
that sequence should now be considered adjacent to each other. This process
should be repeated as many time as possible. You should greedily remove
characters from left to right.

## Example 1

```text
Input: "aaabbbc"
Output: "c"
Explanation:
1. Remove 3 'a': "aaabbbbc" => "bbbbc"
2. Remove 4 'b': "bbbbc" => "c"
````

## Example 2

```text
Input: "aabbbacd"
Output: "cd"
Explanation:
1. Remove 3 'b': "aabbbacd" => "aaacd"
2. Remove 3 'a': "aaacd" => "cd"
```

## Example 3

```text
Input: "aabbccddeeedcba"
Output: ""
Explanation:
1. Remove 3 'e': "aabbccddeeedcba" => "aabbccdddcba"
2. Remove 3 'd': "aabbccdddcba" => "aabbcccba"
3. Remove 3 'c': "aabbcccba" => "aabbba"
4. Remove 3 'b': "aabbba" => "aaa"
5. Remove 3 'a': "aaa" => ""
```

## Example 4

```text
Input: "aaabbbacd"
Output: "acd"
Explanation:
1. Remove 3 'a': "aaabbbacd" => "bbbacd"
2. Remove 3 'b': "bbbacd" => "acd"
```
